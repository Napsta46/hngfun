            come out of the lot and start the second phase of the internship where the tasks get
            increasingly harder.</div>

    I did my primary school at Monika Kindergarten, and my secondary school at Federal Government College, Ikot Ekpene. As you can tell, very much a small town upbringing.
    After that, I moved to Germany to attend University. It was an interesting experience, but after many years in Germany, I decided that I prefer to live in Nigeria.</div>
